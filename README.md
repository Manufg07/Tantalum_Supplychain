## Project Overview

The **Tantalum Supply Chain Project** aims to create transparency and traceability in the tantalum supply chain by leveraging Hyperledger Fabricâ€™s capabilities, such as private data collections (PDCs) and custom chaincode.

### Key Objectives
- Track tantalum ore from mining through refining, including ore compliance verification.
- Ensure secure data sharing with private data collections.
- Implement compliance status tracking directly in ore assets.

---

## Features

- **Blockchain-Backed Traceability**: Immutable record of ore tracking and compliance.
- **Private Data Collections**: Secure data sharing between specific parties.
- **Compliance Management**: Update compliance status fields within ore assets.

---

## Architecture

### Network Structure
- **Organizations**: MiningCompany, RefiningCompany, CertificationAuthority.
- **Private Data Collections**: Configured between `MiningCompany` and `RefiningCompany` for secure ore data sharing.

### Chaincode Structure
- `Tantalum` Chaincode with primary functionalities:
  - Ore registration
  - Compliance status updates
  - Private ore details management
